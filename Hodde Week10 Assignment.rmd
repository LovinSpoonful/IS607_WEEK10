The New York Times web site provides a rich set of APIs, as described here: http://developer.nytimes.com/docs
You'll need to start by signing up for an API key.
Your task is to choose one of the New York Times APIs, construct an interface in R to read in the JSON data, and
transform it to an R dataframe.


Send the request for top emailed sports stories:
```{r}

library(jsonlite)
json <- fromJSON("http://api.nytimes.com/svc/mostpopular/v2/mostemailed/sports/30.json?api-key=sample-key")
```

Convert the list to a data frame:
```{r}
library (plyr)
df <- ldply (json[4], data.frame)
```

Show the column names:
```{r}
length(df)  
names(df) 
```

Show a few examples of how to access the data in a data frame:
```{r}

# title of each story
df[,"title"]

# example of full details of 10th article:
df[10,]

```
